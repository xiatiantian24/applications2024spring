<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Purpose: I would personally use the bike for daily commute. It will be primarily used on city streets but may also need to handle situations like muddy or uneven roads.</p>
<p>Features: A lightweight and durable material like aluminum or carbon fiber. Reliable and responsive brakes for safety. For the tire, I care about the stability on varied terrains and the durability.</p>
<P>UI: I looked for sizing charts provided by the site to see if can fit the back of a car. I will also be looking at ratings and reviews.</P>
