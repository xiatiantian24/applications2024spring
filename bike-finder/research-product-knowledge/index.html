<h1>Research: Product Knowledge</h1>
<p>Shopping Sites:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brooklynbicycleco.com/">Brooklyn Bicycle</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://mikesbikes.com/">Mike's Bikes</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/">Trek Bikes</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bearsbikes.com/fullyearrentals">Bear Bikes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From research, I've learned that bike shopping websites are typically devided into multiple subpages based on the type of road it is used on, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mountain;</li>
    <li>Road;</li>
    <li>Gravel;</li>
    <li>City.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the website might also be divided based on the demographic of the audience and their purpose, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kids;</li>
    <li>Students who are pramirily renting a bike instead of buying one;</li>
    <li>Parts of a bike rather than an entire bike;</li>
    <li>Electric.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Purpose: I would personally use a bike for daily commute. It would be primarily used on city streets but may also need to handle situations like muddy or uneven roads.</p>
<p>Prioritization: I would prioritize safety, price, and brand reputation.</p>
<p>Features: A lightweight and durable material like aluminum or carbon fiber. Reliable and responsive brakes for safety. For the tire, I care about the stability on varied terrains and the durability.</p>
<P>UI: I looked for sizing charts provided by the site to see if can fit the back of a car. I will also be looking at ratings and reviews.</P>
