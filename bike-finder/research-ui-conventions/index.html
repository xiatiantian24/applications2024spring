    <li>shortcut button to shop directly in thumbnail view;</li>
    <li>shows essential specs in thumbnail view, which takes up a lot of space;</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Universal</h3>
<ul>
<li>When comparing products in thumbnail view, it is common to see one or two quick actions available below each thumbnail, such as radio buttons for color selection or CTA button for adding to cart;</li>
<li>In detailed view, all imgae galleries reside on the left side of the screen, while essential information and CTA button are on the right side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specific</h3>
<ul>
<li>While it is common to see an overlay of cart summary after adding the product to the cart, it is non-unanimous where the overlay resides on the screen;</li>
<li>When there is a high level of customization available to the product, there tends to be some navigation options to guide the user to the section they want;</li>
<li>Products that provides more functionality tends to emphasize more on customer reviews;</li>
<li>The site for the mower is the only one that confirms the user selection of warranty before adding to cart;</li>
<li>The site for the laptop is the only one that has the back to top button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>While it is porbably intuitive that clicking outside of the overlay will close it, I think Almada Label does a good job calling that option out and can be applicable to all other sites;</li>
    <li>It stood out to me that all of these websites have a clear sense of whether their products may be purchased in bulk. For those that are likely to be pruchased one at a time, the site eliminates the option to select quantity;</li>
    <li>I like Cubcadet as it shows me estimated delivery days even before I add to cart;</li>
    <li>Cyber Power PC's customization section annoys me a little because it promotes lots of unrelated accessories while marking them as "popular".</li>
    </ul>
