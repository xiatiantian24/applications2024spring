        <p class="fst-italic fs-6">*Apply a scoring algorithm of some kind, or use whatever methods you prefer to identify which stories you MUST address, which you would LIKE to address, and which you can probably dismiss.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">This algorithm reads through each user story and assigns a score based on the presence of user actions and intentions. Specifically, a filtering action = 5 points, a viewing action = 5 points, an intention of experience = 2 points, an intention of performance = 2 points, an intention of maintenance or warranty = 1 point, an intention of budget = 1 point, an intention of aesthetics = 1 point. Summing the points above yields the final score for that user story.</p>
