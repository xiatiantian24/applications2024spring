        <h5>Nate Nelson</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Themes can be more specific... for example "fast down hill"</li>
            <li>Maybe also include options for purpose, such as daily commuting</li>
            <li>Observation: Nate did not comprehend the popular tag; suggests making them like chips at the top</li>
            <li>If there were users reviews would assume the tags were rate by users</li>
            <li>Clear filter may be a bit redundant for each category</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Kristen Wang</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Suggests include review sections for ppl with trust issues</li>
            <li>Highlight / hierarchy key words, such as spine friendly</li>
            <li>Older persona might not care about the specs, a size chart might be enough</li>
            <li>wish to have a comparison chart for price, rating, and picture</li>
            <li>Suggests to move price range filter to higher on top</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Jeffrey Wang</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinks popular tags are more personal than objective specs of the bike</li>
            <li>Thinks material matters less important than its effect, such as light/durable/safe</li>
            <li>Assumes clicking on the tag will take to the entire product (i.e., the tag is not interactive)</li>
            <li>Imagine the right olumn to be summary of the product</li>
            <li>Also suggests to move price range to a higher priority</li>
            <li>Recommendation section may include accessories or bundle sales such as training wheels</li>
        </ul>
