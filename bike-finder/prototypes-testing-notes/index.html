        <h5>Hanna Fu</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Search page:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>filter type hierarchy needs to be improved</li>
                <li>maybe get rid of all caps on tags and features in filter</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Detail page:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>suggests make nav fixed</li>
                <li>breadcrumb feels separate from the rest</li>
                <li>suggests make images bigger</li>
                <li>search bar looks like it's searching within the detail page</li>
                <li>suggests moving specs to down below</li>
                <li>suggests taking out search zipcode since there's no retail store</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>
        <h5>Abram Siemsen</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Search page:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>observation: didn't notice that the filter is scrollable</li>
                <li>suggests adding frame size filter</li>
                <li>the main column could have a height of the page so that it won't scroll</li>
                <li>also thinks the search bar is not making full sense being here; it's visually connecting with the product detail rather than the global control; maybe  collapse it to the top of nav. The new search agency if nice; the tag is a bit confusing</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Detail page:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>for specs, suggests having the space grow as needed, rather than overflow scroll; or moving specs in between product detail and popular add-ons</li>
                <li>the visuals of the section divider and the tab are too similar that it might introduce confusion</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>
        <h5>Krissy Gatuslao</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Search page:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>thinks the clear filter button shouldn't appear until the user makes a selection</li>
                <li>suggests adding a "best seller" option to sort</li>
                <li>suggests adding rating to search results</li>
                <li>suggests adding brand name to search results</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Detail page:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>observation: didn't notice that is a search bar; feels too low on screen; gets confused with tags</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
    </div>
